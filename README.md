## Description

Ai agent to help Non profit organization to create:
* refereneces
* certificates
* internship documents

## Components

There are 3  main components in this application: 
* Input - is a command space and source of information for the ai agent to start the tasks in the MCP server
*  MCP server - is registry  of the tasks, tasks  are defined by prompts and performed by the chosen LLM assistant, 
* Output - is result of the work made in the MCP server generated in the json format and joined with templates of the pdf. The finished product is a **pdf file with the content created by the MCP server actions.**
### input

The command space in the form of the chat assistant. User enters the text data (prompt) into the window with the following information:
* "task" - what route should use in the MCP
* "name" and "surname" to find a record and information in the Excel Sheet that will be connected with the application
* "role" - role name to find in the Excel sheet
* "additional info" is a source of the information of the LLM to parse together with the data from the Excel sheet to generate the output

User need to choose one of the defined **tasks** and submit the data for the prompt that meets all of the above conditions. In case some of the data is missing, the prompt should tell the user to add the missing data before submitting the job to MCP server.

The input prompt should generate a valid json object with  following schema
```
{
	"task": "name of the task",
	"name": "",
